[Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com), one of my favorite online writers, has been
running an increasingly successful membership program for the [last six
years](https://craigmod.com/essays/membership_rules/). A few days ago, he
announced The Good Place, a private, members-only online space, vaguely
Twitter-like with short-form posts, but more focused on conversations. As of
this writing, members get two posts and ten replies a day, each limited to a
thousand characters. Posts and replies disappear after one week, there may be an
option to add a single image per post coming soon. The Good Place is a great
example of what [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) (another excellent
writer to follow) called a [home-cooked
app](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/).


<aside class="sidenote"> Seeing The Good Place come to life has finally pushed
me to get over my skepticism of LLMs and try using one as a programming
partner.</aside>

Last year, [Maggie Appleton
connected](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software/) this variety of
personalized software to the growing power of Large Language Models, suggesting
that LLMs would make it easier for non-professional programmers to write small
pieces of usable, working software for their friends, families and communities.
The Good Place is proof-of-concept for Appleton's idea, since Mod has been
leaning on [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to get things up and working
quickly<span class="sidenote-number"></span>. The software itself seems to be
functioning with only minor issues, and the community itself has quickly grown
into it. Withig a few days interesting links, personal projects, stories and
experiences have been shared, difficulties have been commiserated over, some
advice given, and even a couple of physical-world meetings arranged. When
contrasted against global social media networks like Twitter, Threads, even
Mastodon and Bluesky, the analogy between industrial farmed and processed junk
food and a home-cooked meal writes itself (though The Good Place is perhaps more
of a local potluck dinner).

For a long time now I have been skeptical of two things: first, the idea that
"everyone should learn to code", and second, that LLMs will be widely useful in
any significant way. I'm still skeptical of both those ideas in isolation, but
The Good Place might have convinced me that _together_ they make for a useful
combination. The computing industry as a whole has not made much progress in
lowering the bar for non-professional programmers to build usable software for
themselves. I think it's still pretty hard for someone with absolutely no
programming experience to do useful things, but with LLMs it seems possible for
people with _some_ experience to do things that are more advanced, and to do it
quickly.

Finally, to stretch the cooking analogy a little bit more, I wonder what will be
the equivalent of the local grocery store, or the farmer's market for
home-cooked software. A large part of the difficulty in building usable software
is that the individual components are quite tricky to plug together and keep
running. But if home-cooked software movement does gather enough momentum, it
may make sense for people to start offering services around hosting or packaging
components for them. I can imagine something like Heroku or Fly.io, but even
simpler, and maybe with LLM integrations that make it possible for communities
to build and manage independent systems with little administrative overhead.
Maybe something like this exists already?
