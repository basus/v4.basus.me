It all started innocently enough. I wanted to listen the [Attack on Titan
soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Attack_on_Titan). I've had a
Spotify Premium subscription for about a decade (though I suppose I've made much
less use of it than I could have), and it's usually the first place I turn to
when I want to listen to something. And that's when the trouble started. It
turns out that Spotify on macOS doesn't have any kind of miniplayer, and doesn't
even give you any kind of notification when the track changes. It's a small
thing, but I like to know what I'm listening to. With Spotify, the only way to
do that is by keeping the player open all the time. Eventually, I ended up
getting [Sleeve](https://replay.software/sleeve), a little app for showing and
controlling what I'm listening to, that's compatible with Spotify, Apple Music,
and [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/). I value attention to detail, and
Spotify doesn't, and that it irks me. They still don't have a rounded square
icon on macOS.

All of that made me think about ownership, or rather the lack thereof. We rent
so many things these days. We rent our homes, our cars, our software, our music,
our books and movies, hell, even our relationships. At the same time, physical
paper books, indie bookstores, small makers of various shapes and forms, are
seeing a resurgence. I don't know if _ownership_ is a fundamentally human desire
(I suspect it's not), but going against the current trend, pushing back against
prevailing forces, definitely is. A growing desire to re-assert ownership is
indicative of that.

Personally, I have always had a soft spot for physical books, and have thought
of Kindle books as being rented and temporary. Owning movies (or TV shows) has
never appealed to me. When I was a child, we rarely bought tapes or DVDs, and I
could only watch things when they aired on TV. Ephemerality in visual media
seems natural. I bought CDs of music for a while, still have most of them, I
would like to do that again, perhaps starting with the Attack on Titan
soundtrack. No, I've never been into vinyl, and can't imagine that I ever will
be. I think software subscriptions are fine, especially if you get regular
updates. I am conflicted on home ownership.

Over the years, I have come to experience and internalize that all things are
temporary (for better and for worse). And yet, I like to have nice things, be
grounded in relatively unchanging routines. Maybe this is a chance to embrace
what the Buddhists mean by "non-duality"? Making peace with being in a sea of
rentals and temporaries is perhaps accepting the world as it is. But perhaps
carving out islands of ownership and relative permanence is nudging the world
towards the way we would like it to be.
