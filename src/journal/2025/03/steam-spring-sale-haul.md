The [Steam Spring
Sale](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/520833241446351891) is
in full swing (for one more day), and I picked up a couple of games that were on
steep discounts. I don't know when I'm actually going to get around to actually
playing them, but one can dream. Here's what I got:

- Transport Fever 2 (Deluxe Edition and the Early Supporter Pack). I'm a
  sucker for city-builder style games. This seems fun and simpler than, say,
  Cities Skylines.
- DOOM Anthology. This includes DOOM, DOOM 2, DOOM 3, DOOM 64 as well as DOOM
  2016 and DOOM Eternal that I already have. Is that enough DOOM in my life?
  Maybe, at least until DOOM: The Dark Ages comes out later this year.
- Quake Collection Bundle. This includes Quake 1-4, Quake Live and Quake
  Champions. We first got a computer at home in 2021, and that Christmas I got
  Quake 3 Arena. Sadly, I never got to play it because our computer didn't have
  enough RAM to share with the video card, and my dad wouldn't spend on a
  graphics card. Better late than never I suppose.
- Frostpunk 2. I played the original Frostpunk during the COVID lockdowns and
  really enjoyed it. From what I can tell, this is just as good, but different,
  so I'm looking forward to it.
  
Talking about better late than never, a few years ago for Christmas I got myself
a Christmas tree and a Nintendo Switch. As a child I always wanted a Christmas
tree and a Nintendo console, but never got them. There is something very healing
and empowering about giving yourself the things you were once dependent on
others for.
