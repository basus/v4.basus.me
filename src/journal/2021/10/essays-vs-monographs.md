A few days ago, author [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com "Austin Kleon")
wrote [a
post](https://austinkleon.com/2021/09/27/if-a-book-can-be-summarized-is-it-worth-reading/
"If a book can be summarized, is it worth reading?") critiquing the growing
culture of summarizing books instead of actually reading them. His critique is
two-fold. First, if a book can in fact be adequately summarized, perhaps it is
not worth reading in full in the first place. A corollary to that then is that
books that are harder to summarize are more valuable. Having just finished
[Olivia Laing’s](http://www.olivialaing.co.uk "Olivia Laing") excellent *[The
Lonely City](https://www.olivialaing.com/lonely-city "The Lonely City")*, I find
myself agreeing with this. I’ve tried summarizing it in conversation with
friends multiple times and I never feel like I’m doing the book justice.

Kleon’s second critique is that if a book can be summarized, is it worth writing
in the first place? He talks about the current book publishing process where a
book is sold based on a proposal, in effect a summary, the marketing beginning
even before the book is written. Kleon says:

> This is the sensible, professional way of working, but for me it is a kind of
> creative death, antithetical to the reason I write in the first place: to
> discover what I know, or discover [what I don’t want to
> know](https://austinkleon.com/2019/08/02/writing-to-find-out-what-you-dont-want-to-know/),
> to invent something on the page that couldn’t exist unless I went to the page
> to have an experience in the first place.

Having never published a book, I’m not in a position to comment on his main
argument. However, I think Kleon is describing a sort of *essay*, which
[according to Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/essay
"Definition of essay") is, an “*analytic or interpretative literary composition
usually dealing with its subject from a limited or personal point of view*”, or
alternately “*an initial tentative effort”*. That is, an essay is fundamentally
an exploration, an exercise in considering a topic from different perspectives,
often personal, and [not necessarily coming to a definite
conclusion](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/08/what-makes-a-great-essay/
"What Makes a Great Essay?"). An essay is a thought process, in written form.

**Aside:** it’s not lost on me that this definition of essay is the complete
opposite of the typical meaning adopted by educational systems around the world
(at least, the ones I’ve been exposed to). Most “essay questions” on homeworks
or exams expect persuasive answers, presenting arguments and guiding the reader
towards a definitive conclusion, the anti-thesis of the above definition.

By contrast, a monograph is: “a learned treatise on a small area of learning”
(also [from
Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monograph
"Definition of Monograph")). Writing a monograph will probably require
exploration, investigation and learning, but that is not the *point* of the
writing. They are complementary and perhaps interleaved processes, but unlike an
essay, they are not the *same* process. A monograph is a summary (or at least a
survey) of knowledge in a particular area. A PhD dissertation, for example, is
closer to a monograph than it is to an essay. This post, and Kleon’s, are closer
to essays than it they are to monographs.

At the end of Kleon’s post, he asks:

> Maybe there’s a third path here. Maybe it’s possible to write something that
> is easily summarized but impossible to sum up…

I wonder if monographs fit that bill.
