I finally got around to watching Denis Villeneuve's
[Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/) over the weekend. I appreciated
how beautiful and well-considered it was, but I'll have to watch it again to
make up my mind as to how much I actually liked it. It also very clearly felt
like the first half of a movie, rather than a complete one. All that being said,
what really struck me is what one of the characters, Jamis, says in one of Paul
Atreides' visions:

> The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. A
> process that cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move with the flow
> of the process. We must join it.

I've been semi-seriously studying Zen Buddhism for the past few years, and over
the last month have been reading DT Suzuki's excellent [Essays in Zen
Buddhism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802151183/braipick-20). The
little bit of monologue above reminded me of something that Suzuki writes in the
introduction:

> Life as it is lived suffices. It is only when the disquieting intellect steps
> in and tries to murder it that we stop to live and imagine ourselves to be
> short of or in something. Let the intellect alone, it has its usefulness in
> the proper sphere, but let it not interfere with the flowing of the life
> stream. If you are at all tempted to look into it, do so while letting it
> flow. The fact of flowing must under no circumstances be arrested or meddled
> with; for the moment your hands are dipped into it, its transparency is
> disturbed, it ceases to reflect your image which you have had from the very
> beginning and will continue to have to the end of time.

The same idea, told in two different ways, in two different contexts. [Be like
