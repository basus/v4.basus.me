I've spent most of the last couple weeks on Version 4 of this site. It's been
live for about a week now, with lots of tinkering happening as I figure out how
I actually want to use it and what I want to publish to it. A detailed post
about the transition is in the works and coming soon (hopefully tomorrow). Till
then, here are a couple of posts on building personal websites from around the
web.

**[An alarmingly concise and very hinged summary of what it was liked to build
this site from scratch](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/an-alarmingly-concise-and-very-hinged-summary-of-what-it-was-like-to-build-this-site-from-scratch/)**

As the title probably gives away, this was a very entertaining read. Keennan
talks about his growing dissatisfaction with his previous hosts, expressing
sentiments that a lot of us might identify with. His blow-by-blow account of how
he went from deciding to move away to actually going through all the steps of
actually building his site (including frustrations along the way), makes for a
good story of perseverance, struggle, and also asking and getting help from
other people. If he can make the transition with very little prior knowledge of
websites and programming, so can anyone else.

**[Don't forget you're making
webpages](https://mikesusz.dev/blog/dont-forget/)**

I have been known on occasion [to wish that](https://mastodon.social/@basus/112910022029579406 "Link to Mastodon post") we could go back to a web that was
mainly for sites and pages, rather than applications or services (and certainly
not for advertising and filled AI slop). Like the author, I was pretty amazed
when I figured out that I could write and publish my own webpages that other
people could read, essentially for free (though I had that realization much
later than the author did). Over the last few months, I've been rediscovering
just how much joy it gives me to build and share web pages, and I hope it's
something I'll keep doing for a long time ago.

**[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design)**

If you do go down the route of building your own website, it doesn't have to be
fancy, or a lot of work. In addition to sticking to standards as the previous
post suggests, you can get a very functional website with very minimal design,
and brutalist web design will tell you how. Personally, I'm not aiming to be
brutalist, I do like beautiful fonts and fun colors, but my preferred minimal
aesthetic does have a lot of overlap with a brutalist style.

**[My Failed Personal Site
Redesign](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/my-failed-peronsal-site-redesign/)**

And on a completely different note, you can also go a completely different route
and build something with a lot of flair that chimes with your personality and
taste. Even though Nielsen didn't go through with his hand-drawn website
redesign, it's still an interesting experiment and he has some pointers to other
people who _do_ have fun visual elements.
