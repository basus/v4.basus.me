title: Status Update for August 2024
description: What I've been up to for the month of August
tags: ["Life", "Monthly"]
---

For a while now, I've been wanting to some kind of regular status update entry,
inspired by people like [Drew
Devault](https://drewdevault.com/2022/10/15/Status-update-October-2022.html) and
[Simon Ser](https://emersion.fr/). But of course, life and my general inability
to actually plan things kept getting in the way. Now that I both have some time
on my hands, and have a revamped website, I thought I would finally go ahead and
get started. For the time being, I'm not sticking to a strict format, we'll see
how things grow and evolve. For now, I'll include a section on the main things
I'm working on, things I've been thinking about, as well as media I've been
experiencing.

## Projects

### v4.basus.me

The main project for this month has been this website. I started experimenting
with [Lume](https://lume.land) in July, but I started a fresh repo at the
beginning of the month and started moving pages over from previous versions of
the site. I've already written at length [about Version
4](/journal/2024/08/version-4/), so I won't reiterate all that here. The overall
design and structure is stable, the [journal](/journal) and [stream](/stream)
are working well, and I'm gradually adding both new material, and moving over
material from older blogs and sites (starting with my old Tumblr).

### Beautiful Racket

I've been wanting to get into the Racket ecosystem for a while now, but never
really did. This month I started working through Matthew Butterick's excellent
[Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com), which explores Racket's most
powerful ability: being able to create your own mini-languages. I'm progressing
pretty quickly because I both have some prior exposure to Racket, and general
knowledge about programming languages, compilers, interpreters and the like. I'm
really enjoying it so far, and already have some ideas for things I want to
build in the near future.

### <span class="codename">Project Bracer Phoenix</span>

This is a project I'm not quite ready to talk about yet, so I'm talking a page
out of the [Laundry
Files](https://thelaundryfiles.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Code_names) and giving
it a code name for the time being. For now, let's just say that <span
class="codename">Project Bracer Phoenix</span> involves TypeScript and social
media. TypeScript is easy enough to pick up and surprisingly nice to work with,
though managing dependencies is a bit confusing. This should be public with core
functionality working in the next month, so stay tuned!

## Media

I have been trying out a bunch of reading trackers:
[Goodreads](http://goodreads.com), [The StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com)
and [Literal](https://literal.club) and I don't particularly like any of them.
I'm getting more serious about tracking my media consumption, and I have a
feeling I'm going to be rolling my own solution sooner rather than later. That
might be the next big addition to the site.

### Reading

- **<span class="book">The Art of Solitude</span>** by Stephen Batchelor.
Honestly, I picked up and put down this book so many times with long gaps in
between, it didn't make much of an impression (which probably says something
about the book). I think if you're already knowledgable about eastern
philosophy, psychedelics or neuroscience, then you won't get much out of this.
- **<span class="book">The Mountain in the Sea</span>** by Ray Nayler. It's been
a while since I've read science fiction, but this has been a delight so far. I'm
only about a tenth of way in, but there's already rich worldbuilding,
interesting characters and concepts, and a aura of mystery and intrigue that I
can't wait to get to the bottom of.

### Watching

- **Season 4 of <span class="tv">The Umbrella Academy</span>**. Man, the writers
really phoned it in on this one.
- **<span class="tv">The Office</span>**. An old favorite that I still enjoy
just as much, and I have successfully gotten my parents hooked as well.
- **Season 1 of <span class="tv">Teen Titans</span>**. I just started this, but
  I have a feeling it's going to be a keeper.

## Thoughts

I've been thinking a lot about the fractured social media in the post-Twitter
era, the IndieWeb, the Fediverse, and how we can create sustainable online
communities and services. I also realized that the web and websites were one of
my "first loves" and I regret neglecting them both for the last decade. Now I'm
happy to be re-exploring that love, and also getting a trip out of actually
writing networked programs.

That's all I can think about that's worth mentioning at the moment. I don't have
much planned for September besides continuing to work on the projects above,
eating lots of delicious Indian food while I still can, and hopefully getting
some good news about future plans.

That's all for August, see you next month (though more like see you tomorrow).
