description: An ode to monospace
tags: ["Programming"]

Today's Sunday Selection is an ode to monospace. I'm enjoying the current design
of the site, but I have a feeling that an all-monospace redesign is coming in
the not-too-distant future.

**[Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) and
[Sono](https://etceteratype.co/sono)**

I stumbled across these two lovely monospace typefaces a while ago. Sono is a
"soft monospace" with a proportional variant. While it's clearly a monospace, it
doesn't look as "techie" as such fonts often do, it works well as a body text
typeface. By contrast Berkeley Mono (via BSAG) is a much more industrial-looking
typeface that feels like at home in a software manual, or part of futuristic UI.
I'm not sure I'd use it for programming, but I would definitely consider for a
website, poster or book. Except one or both to show up here in the future.

**[The Monospace Web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/)**

This is a gorgeous, minimalist, design exploration by Oskar Wickstr√∂m that I'm
going to keep close at hand for future reference. If I ever create a purely
technical website, or app, this is a style I'm going to come back to. I love how
a considered use of monospace (and monochrome) can look both classic and modern
at the same time. Not only did I see some fun design in action, I also learned
about the existence of [box-drawing
characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters).

**[Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)**

Not quite monospace, but keeping with the minimalist theme, Phosphor is set of
over 9,000 icons with a consistent, clean design and a variety options for use
(including with popular web frameworks). Personally, I've been using [Feather
icons](https://feathericons.com/) and while they're lightweight and easy to use,
the selection is pretty limited. I'm probably going to swap them out for
Phosphor sooner rather than later.
